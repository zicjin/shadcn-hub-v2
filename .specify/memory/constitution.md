# Spec App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
within the system. Duplication is a source of inconsistency and maintenance burden.
Extract common functionality into reusable libraries, functions, or configurations.
When repetition seems necessary, first seek abstraction opportunities.

### II. Orthogonality & Decoupling
Components must be designed to be independent and interchangeable. Changes to one
module should not ripple through unrelated parts of the system. Achieve this through
clear interfaces, dependency injection, and avoiding global state. Each component
should do one thing well and have minimal knowledge of others.

### III. Tracer Bullets & Prototyping
Build end-to-end functionality early to validate the approach. Start with a simple,
working implementation that exercises all layers of the architecture. This reveals
integration issues early and provides a scaffold for incremental enhancement.
Users see progress sooner and can provide feedback on actual working software.

### IV. Reversibility & Flexibility
Avoid locking into irreversible decisions. Design systems assuming that requirements,
technologies, and environments will change. Use configuration over hard-coding,
interfaces over concrete implementations, and maintain clear separation between
business logic and infrastructure. Critical decisions should be easy to reverse.

### V. Test-Driven Development
Write tests before implementation. Every feature must have automated tests that
define its expected behavior. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly:
write a failing test, implement just enough to pass, then refactor for clarity.
Tests are documentation, specification, and safety net combined.

### VI. Good Enough Software
Understand when to stop perfecting. Software must be good enough for users,
future maintainers, and your peace of mind. Know when you're trading
diminishing returns for complexity. Ship working software early and iterate
based on real usage rather than imagined perfection.

### VII. The Broken Window Theory
Never leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unfixed.
One hack leads to another, and soon the codebase entropy becomes unmanageable.
Fix problems as you discover them. If a proper fix isn't immediately feasible,
at least acknowledge it with a TODO and a plan.

## Development Workflow

### Communication & Documentation
- Use meaningful names that reveal intent
- Document the why, not the what (code shows what)
- Keep documentation close to code and up-to-date
- Maintain a project glossary for domain terms
- Practice active communication with stakeholders

### Estimating & Planning
- Estimate in ranges, not single values
- Break large tasks into smaller, measurable pieces
- Iterate the schedule with the code
- Keep a project daybook for decisions and learnings
- Prototype to validate risky assumptions

### Debugging & Problem Solving
- Don't panic - read the error message carefully
- "select" isn't broken - the problem is likely in your code
- Reproduce issues reliably before attempting fixes
- Fix the root cause, not symptoms
- Add regression tests for every bug fixed

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass automated tests before merge
- Code coverage must not decrease with new changes
- Static analysis tools must run without errors
- Performance benchmarks must stay within acceptable ranges
- Security scanning must pass for dependencies

### Design Quality
- Minimize coupling between modules (aim for <3 dependencies per module)
- Maximize cohesion within modules
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable
- Design by contract - define preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- Use design patterns appropriately, not universally

### User Experience Focus
- Error messages must be actionable and helpful
- Features must be discoverable without documentation
- Performance must be perceptible (response <200ms for UI)
- Accessibility must be built-in, not bolted-on
- Privacy and security by default

## Governance

### Amendment Process
- Proposed amendments must be documented with rationale
- Changes require team consensus or designated approver
- Breaking changes require migration plan
- Version bump according to semantic versioning
- Amendments must propagate to all dependent templates

### Compliance & Review
- All code reviews must verify principle adherence
- Quarterly principle effectiveness review
- Exceptions must be documented with justification
- New team members must acknowledge constitution
- Constitution supersedes conflicting practices

### Continuous Improvement
- Maintain a "lessons learned" log
- Regular retrospectives to identify process improvements
- Encourage experimentation in designated sandbox areas
- Share knowledge through pair programming and code reviews
- Invest in tooling that enforces principles automatically
